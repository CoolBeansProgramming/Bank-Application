# Bank 


## Summary 

Using OOP concepts, I created a bank application system that somewhat simulates ATM transactions. You and another individual can register as new users, make deposits into your account, do withdraws, and check account balances. 

##

In this application I have one parent and one child class. Functions in the account class prompt the user to enter how much they would like to deposit or withdraw and will repeat the total transaction amount and current balance after the transaction is completed. 

The user menu option lets the client choose the type of transaction they would like to do. They can also see the total number of deposits or withdraws they have done. 

The new user option asks the customer for their name, age, and if they would like to register a new users; data is stored simultaneously for both users.
