# Bank 


Executives at Lambda Bank are interested in exploring what types of transactions their customers are conducting. They are primarily interested in transactions that transfer funds from their institution to competitor banks and other financial institutions. In this project, I will use SQL, Python, and Tableau to analyze these transactions and present my findings to executives. I will also create a bank system application and web page to market ads to customers that are moving their funds to competitors.
